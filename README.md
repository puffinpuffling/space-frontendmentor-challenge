# Space Tourism Frontendmentor Challenge

This is my attempt at the Space Tourism webpage challenge. I did not go ahead and add JS because I at the time this was made haven't gotten that far yet. This is my 2nd serious go at making a webpage using modern HTML/CSS. All the pictures, text and the empty html-pages were pre-supplied, the rest I made myself. 

Some things I had to figure along the way:
- how to use the gradient for the navbar to make it look good
- changing how a link looks depending on where you are on the page
- different types of buttons (and making round ones)


What I would like to improve going ahead: 
- The responsiveness of the webpage, I am assuming that it is possible with JS for example to change the content dynamically without having to reload a seperate webpage every time I want to view something else. 
- The Flexbox layout felt cumbersome, and could probably need a revisit
